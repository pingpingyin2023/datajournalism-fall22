## I. Data Driven Investigation Critique  
**Original Story: Advocates Worry Vaccines Will Be Out Of Reach For Black and Hispanic Neighborhoods Devastated By COVID-19**  [link text](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/09/texas-coronavirus-vaccine-racial-inequality/)
### Clarity and accuracy 
1. I can immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate.  5  
   ◆ The central insight of this piece was vaccine distribution centers were more common in white, affluent neighborhoods than in communities of color in Texas's largest metropolitan areas.  
   ◆ The core information was also included in both the headline and subtitle.  
2. There was a data visualization that is easy to understand. 5  
   ◆ I think the most efficient way to illustrate the investigation result is to show the vaccine distribution sites on the map of demography. Just like what the reporters did for their story.  
   ◆ An idea of improvement may be to add some interactive elements. For example, the whole map uses the same color, but when your mouse hovers over a particular area, that area will change its color to tell you what is the majority of residents there, people of color or white. Readers may be more interested in the results of their own exploration and be more impressed by the data.
3. I think the data is accurate. 5  
   ◆ I don't have questions about the accuracy of the data.  
   ◆ The reporters provided two sources of the data, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Census Bureau. I think these two sources are precisely what they should refer to for the story. I cannot come up with ideas for more sources because it was a simple fact from my perspective.  
   ◆ The graphic only presented four counties of Texas. It did not explain why the reporters selected these four as typical examples. 
### Quality
The graphic was executed at a high degree of quality. 5  
  ◆ The graphic clearly presented that vaccination distribution sites are more common in majority non-Hispanic white neighborhoods.  
  ◆ It's said in the story that the death and infection rates of COVID in brown and black communities are higher than the white, affluent neighborhoods. But the vaccines provided there were insufficient. This conflict was not illustrated by the graphic.  
### Type and color 
1. Type 5  
  ◆The overall layout of the graphic was clear and distinct, all the elements belonged together.  
  ◆The title, the brief paragraph and the gradient color bar on the top concisely generalized the central idea of the graphic, as well as the results of the investigation. Those elements effectively guided the readers to understand how to read it.  
  ◆The four counties were laid out as a table, explicitly showing the vaccination distribution sites in areas with different demographics.  
2. Color 5  
  ◆The graphic used contrasting colors ranging from dark orange to steel blue. Different colors represented different percentages of people of color and non-Hispanic white. The colors looked comfortable, implied to the colors of skin and eyes of residents in different areas.  
  ◆Data sources were laid out at the bottom with a light grey letter color, which can be distinguished from other main elements and would not distract readers' attention.  
  ◆The vaccine distribution site was presented as the hollow circle, which was good. Hollow circles didn't occupy too much space as the graphic size was limited.  
### Creativity 
  ◆The graphic concentrated the general idea and investigation results that the reporters mostly wanted to communicate. Rather than randomly interviewing residents in different areas, using a data graphic was more persuasive and distinct. Readers could catch the overall vaccine distribution sites and tell the disparity by a cursory glance at it.  
  ◆Effectiveness is 5.  

## II.Final Project Pitch Note
### The Question I want to answer
I would like to conduct a news story to investigate *__how many voters who were previously not interested in the mid-term election were eventually determined to vote because of the Roe v Wade overturning decision of the Supreme Court?__*  
### What data will be available?
1. How many voters registered after June 24th when the Roe’s overturning decision was released?
2. What are the distinctive characters of these voters? *(i.e.gender, age, education)*
3. How many states have voter registrations increased significantly after June 24? 
4. What are the mid-term election results in these states?
### What is the news hook? What makes it timely?
After the mid-term, readers may be eager to know which elements affect the ultimate mid-term results and how profoundly they do. Some analysts predicted Roe’s overturning decision would greatly help Democrats garner more votes. I want to know whether it is the truth through investigative interviews and data analysis.
### Sources?
1. Voters registered after June 24th abortion ruling
2. Staff of key states board of election
3. Political scientists, researchers and analysts
### Anything else?
