## Clarity and accuracy 
1. I can immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate.  5  
   _ The central insight was vaccine distribution centers were more common in white, affluent neighborhoods than in communities of color in Texas's largest metropolitan areas.  
  _ The core information was also concisely included in both the headline and subtitle.  
2. There was a data visualization which is easy to understand how to read. 5  
   _ I think the most efficient way to illustrate the investigation result is to show the vaccine distribution sites on the map of demography. Just like what the reporters did for their story.  
   _ An idea of improvement may be to add some interactive elements. For example, the whole map uses the same color, but when your mouse hovers over a particular area, that area will change its color to tell you what is the majority of residents there, people of color or white. Readers may be more interested in the results of their own exploration and be more impressed by the data.
3. I think the data is accurate. 5  
   _ I don't have question about the accuracy of the data.  
   _ The reporters provided two sources of the data, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Census Bureau. I think these two sources are precisely what they should refer to for the story. I cannot come up with ideas for more sources because it was a simple fact from my perspective.  
   _ The graphic only presented four counties of Texas. It did not explain why the reporters selected these four as typical examples.
