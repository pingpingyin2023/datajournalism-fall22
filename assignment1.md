## Clarity and accuracy 
1. I can immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate.  5  
   ◆ The central insight was vaccine distribution centers were more common in white, affluent neighborhoods than in communities of color in Texas's largest metropolitan areas.  
   ◆ The core information was also concisely included in both the headline and subtitle.  
2. There was a data visualization which is easy to understand how to read. 5  
   ◆ I think the most efficient way to illustrate the investigation result is to show the vaccine distribution sites on the map of demography. Just like what the reporters did for their story.  
   ◆ An idea of improvement may be to add some interactive elements. For example, the whole map uses the same color, but when your mouse hovers over a particular area, that area will change its color to tell you what is the majority of residents there, people of color or white. Readers may be more interested in the results of their own exploration and be more impressed by the data.
3. I think the data is accurate. 5  
   ◆ I don't have question about the accuracy of the data.  
   ◆ The reporters provided two sources of the data, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Census Bureau. I think these two sources are precisely what they should refer to for the story. I cannot come up with ideas for more sources because it was a simple fact from my perspective.  
   ◆ The graphic only presented four counties of Texas. It did not explain why the reporters selected these four as typical examples. 
## Quality
The graphic was executed at a high degree of quality. 5  
  ◆ The graphic clearly presented that vaccination distribution cites are more common in majority non-Hispanic white neighborhoods.  
  ◆ It's said in the story that the death and infection rates of COVID in brown and black communities are higher than the white, affluent neighborhoods. But the vaccines provided there were insufficient. This conflict was not illustrated by the graphic.  
## Type and color 
1.Type 5  
  ◆The overall layout of the graphic was clear and distinct, all the elements belonged together.  
  ◆The title, the brief paragraph and the gradient color bar on the top concisely generalized the central idea of the graphic, as well as the results of the investigation. Those elements effectively guided the readers to understand how to read it.  
  ◆The four counties were laid out as a table, explicitly showing the vaccination distribution sites in areas with different demographics.  
2.Color 5
  ◆The graphic used contrasting colors ranging from dark orange to steel blue. Different colors represented different percentages of people of color and non-Hispanic white. The colors looked comfortable, implied to the colors of skin and eyes of residents in different areas.  
  ◆Data sources were laid out at the bottom with a light grey letter color, which can be distinguished from other main elements and would not distract readers' attention.  
  ◆The vaccine distribution site was presented as hollow circle, which was good It didn't occupy too much space as the graphic size was limited.
